# LeetCode

A collection of LeetCode solutions, written by me.


## How to Run

### Nix users
...can optionally run:
```bash
nix develop
```
In the root directory, to install any required packages.


### VSCode users
...can optionally install the suggested extensions.

The Java language server extension is buggy, you must import the gradle Java 
build files manually, and when prompted to, choose `Let Me Select...` when the 
popup appears.

If the popup does not appear, run `java.clean.workspace` in your command pallet.


### Everyone
...can run:
```bash
./gradlew projects
```
To view every currently available solution.

<br/>

```bash
./gradlew :<project-name>:test
```
To run the tests in `<project-name>/test`.

<br/>

```bash
./gradlew :<project-name>:run
```
To run the `public static void main(String[] args)` method in 
`<project-name>/src/Solution.java` if one is present (that's up to you).
